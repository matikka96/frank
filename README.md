# Frank student card (unofficial)

I got tired of the buggy and poorly made Frank up and decided create a clone of my own solely for showing student ID.

**This is not an official student ID. Please don't abuse this ðŸ˜Š**

## Tech stack

- React.js
- TypeScript (horribly used, was not sure how to handle TS with localstorage, therefore _any_)
- Ionic

App hosted with GitHub Pages, link on the sidebar. 

## Setup

1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm start
